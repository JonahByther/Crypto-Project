# Crypto-Project
In this project, we implemented the caesar cipher algorithm and the vigenere cipher algorithm. They both look at a text file and they replace the characters in that file with different characters based on the algorithm. The caesar algorithm replaces each character based on an key that is an integer. The vigenere algorithm replaces each character based on a key that is a string. There is a message.txt file in the files so you can edit it, or leave it as is, and when you encrypt it, a new file will be created that will have the encryption on it. If you encrypt the file that was created, and use the same key, it will turn into the original message.txt file.
